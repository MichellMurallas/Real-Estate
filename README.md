# Real-Estate
This is a short description about the content of my proyect:
Real-Estate is a project that is under construction.
It is desired that through this project, real estate negotiations can be carried out.

## Content
This project contains two branches, which are:
master,
dev,
dependencies.
maestro will be kept absolutely clean until the project is finished, then from there you can see the webApp.
dev will be in constant maintenance.
dependencies will be the invisible branch, since from there the pull-reques will be made to the dev branch.
